ReauxLimberry,"Vertical Investment?

I'm new-ish to the game. Played at launch for a few months and stopped, recently came back on a fresh account and I'm having a blast.

I am looking to invest vertically in my account instead of having a bunch of characters that I won't use often.

Wriothesley and Baizhu are my first 5*

Looking at current and future, rumored, banners I don't know who to pull for to get the best usage.

Furina seems useful based on the vids and guides I've seen. But Xilonen seems to have more team flexibility with her res shred, especially with cons. Venti was always a favorite of mine but he seems less relevant now because of the switch to more large bosses instead of groups of mobs?

Any recommendations would be helpful.",13/3/2025 17:56
RedEyedPig,"This is my current Furina build. Should I just dip out of GT domain and craft her the HP/cr/cd goblet or sands at 5.5? Got decent off piece goblet too so sands would be cheaper to craft and get similar results. Ill post it below. Got other domains to run too but didnt want to leave Furina with bad goblet.

MikaelPorter,"for Wrio you can use either Melt or Freeze teams  
Best characters for these teams are Furina, Yelan, Xingqiu, Mona for Freeze  
Xiangling, Bennett, Mavuika, PMC for melt  
Xilonen, Kazuha, Lan Yan for both

Baizhu is played on Aggravate/Spread or Bloom/Hyperbloom teams  
Alhaitham, Keqing, Clorinde, Tighnari for main dps for either Aggravate or Spread  
Fischl, Yae Miko for sub dps on those teams  
Kazuha, Sucrose, Lan Yan for buffers if your main dps is eletro

For Bloom, Nilou is a must have, so is Nahida  
Kokomi, Xingqiu, Yelan, Furina are great hydro applicators

For Hyperbloom, Furina, Yelan, Xingqiu  
Kuki for hyperbloom is also a must have if your main dps is a dendro unit, if you dont have her, Fischl or Yae Miko are great  
Clorinde or Cyno are the best eletro main dps for Hyperbloom, Alhaitham and Tighnari are the best dendro dps for it  
Nahida is great for Eletro Main dps (she works well with both eletro and dendro units, but if you use a dendro dps + baizhu, theres no need for nahida there)

FlowyFlorie,"Hyperbloom being her most optimal team says a lot about her status atm. She really just isn't that good at low investments. In fact you can replace eula in those hyperbloom teams with better chars too, so it's not like she's wanted there. 


Yeah I pulled for her back in the 1.x patches. I loved her normal attack string and her bursts damage potential. But she just has so many issues to function properly. Backlogged ult that can easily miss mobile enemies, enemies having physical resistance is more common than the others, still looking for proper physical support chars (Mika was a nice try but he kinda really wasnt THE physical support), energy hungry, and has difficulties with shields. 


Anyway if you're going for c6 you can just ignore my post. She's perfectly fine and really fun at that level of investment.


Edit: if you still want to try low investment Eula and want to play her normally, by all means go for it. Her current best team appears to be Raiden/Furina/C6 Mika or Charlotte or not c6 Bennett.

The 5-star versions are strictly better (iirc higher base stats, can level to 20 instead of 16), so once you have access to those, there's little reason to use 4-star ones other than saving time (re)farming for upgrades.

Mavuika can be used as Sub dps too though

For Mavuika, her best team is Xilonen Bennett Citlali, but you can put Furina or Kazuha in her team

For Kinich, his best team is Emilie Bennett Xiangling, but you can use Collei PMC or Mavuika

Neuvillette best team is Furina Xilonen Kazuha, but Ororon, Fischl, Nahida, Zhongli, Sucrose, Xiangling, Mavuika, Kachina work too

For Alhaitham, his best team is Nahida Kuki Yelan, but Baizhu, Fischl, Yae Miko, Xingqiu, Furina work too

For Navia, i don't know her well, but she is the only geo character depending on cristalize reaction, so someone like Xingqiu, Yelan, Xiangling, Bennett, Fischl, Yae Miko work well with her

Xilonen is a character i 100% recomend pulling, not only she is very strong and versatile, you actually need her on most teams of the characters you mentioned

Appearance is also one of the many selling point characters has, if we're being real. A faceless character doesn't feel like it would've cut it for HoYo, ngl. Also, the rest of the Fatui that did become playable had their own base identity as a playable entity in the end.",17/3/2025 2:14

Mascoretta,"As a Capitano fan I think it’s because 1) more people believe Capitano will be playable after Arlechinno was made playable and because his leaks, unlike Signora, make him seem more likely to be playable than not. Signora straight up had a model that was unplayable and 2) just general impatience as more female characters are getting released (mostly with characters like Varesa who weren’t really in the story at all) 

I do get why fans are frustrated — I think if Genshin wasn’t releasing male characters so sparsely the frustration would be a lot more minimal. But it’s still not an excuse for the aggression and excessive doomposting some fans have been spreading. This is why I always advise people to keep their expectations low — or else you’ll become very negative really quickly when you feel disappointed.",17/3/2025 0:39
let_us_not-,"Most likely because theres not a lot of ways they can make sense of him coming back after Natlan is over + the simulanka references have been spot on up until now so if the part about him not getting off that throne is the only one they manage to fuck up then obviously the players have got every right to be upset. that along with the fact that hes literally the number 1 harbinger but his story so far was relatively underwhelming, so people were already salty about the way he was handled. signora didnt have even half of that going for her.",17/3/2025 1:00
Particular_Painter_4,"I'd take a guess and say it's coz Signora acted more like a villain compared to The Captain who was actually honorable and had a great first impression compared to the former who hasn't been gracious at all since the game's release. This was left festering for around a year till her conclusion when Inazuma was released.

That or there was little to no precedence of Fatui Harbingers being playable, with one exception being Tartaglia at the time. Now we have 3 playable harbingers with so a precedence has been established, creating an expectation that none-evil and redeemable Fatui Harbingers will be playable. 

I'm not saying one should happen or the other or vice versa. That's just been my observation since Genshin released back in 2020 with the impression and pattern Mihoyo has been displaying for almost 5 years.",17/3/2025 0:37

transcended_goblin,"Yeah, but you need to angle your constructs and all that. At least with her, you just pop the skill, climb, ground pound, and do the same with the other pillar. Way faster and more intuitive.",16/3/2025 18:20
Away-Reception587,Didnt know lanyan counted a dash character?,16/3/2025 17:41
Queer-Coffee,Are you responding to someone else? I said that you can't climb them normally and that there isn't a boss mechanic that lets you climb them regardless of the character you use,16/3/2025 18:06
htp-di-nsw,"Yeah, so there's a weird glitch with these things.  They're supposed to be *unclimbable.* It's supposed to be a hard stop unless you have basically any Natlan character other than Mualani, or a flying/jumping character like Xianyun, Lanyan, Kazuha, Wanderer, Venti, etc.

However, they messed it up somehow, and you can occasionally get a grip and climb using shorter characters, like the chibis and sometimes the short women.",16/3/2025 17:49
IS_Mythix,Yeah it only works for medium female and tall male models I think,16/3/2025 17:45

Only Tall Female can't 😂",16/3/2025 19:47
MikuFag101,"It's because her skill is a dash, so she can use it to get on top of the pillar, this works for every other character with the same type of skill (Keqing, Alhaitham, Lanyan). In general, any character that lets you go high up in the air, wether it's through a high jump or flight, allows you to get on top of the pillars without having to use a Natlan character with a climbing mechanic, for example I used Ororon's special jump in the current Abyss to do so",16/3/2025 20:57

DarkDemonDan,"I did it before they made fishing easy. Strike now is always on two bite animations and it is so much easier to stay in the bars.

Jossokar,"you know? After the catch, i havent bothered with fishing again.

Which is fun, because there were fish-related weapons too in sumeru and fontaine.

Literally, in fontaine there is a sword that is in theory the best option for F2p furina.

Really? Dont care. Favonius sword!!

In my case i got the catch during raiden's first banner. Just after i started playing. It meant a work of literal months, maxing that thing up.

So i havent touched the fishing system in almost 4 years",16/3/2025 10:08
